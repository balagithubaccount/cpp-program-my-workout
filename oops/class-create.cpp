/*
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

    OOP is faster and easier to execute
    OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
    OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
    OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

// Create a class called "MyClass":
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

  public:             // Access specifier
    int myNum;        // Attribute (int variable)
    string myString;  // Attribute (string variable)
    float myFloat;    // Attribute (float variable)

int main()
